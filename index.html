					<p class="paragraph1">
						Australia has listed the koala as an endangered species across most of its east coast, after a dramatic decline in numbers.</p>
	
					<div class="section-ph2"><p class="paragraph2">The once-thriving marsupial has been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.</p></div>
	
					<div class="section-ph3"><p class="paragraph3">The federal government said the listing was for Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).</p></div>
	
					<p class="paragraph4">It has been urged to do more to protect koalas from rapidly diminishing habitats and climate change.</p>
	
					<p class="paragraph5">The species was listed as "vulnerable" in those states and territory only in 2012. Despite the rapid deterioration, governments have been accused of dithering.</p>
	
					<div class="section-ph6"><p class="paragraph6"><span class="quote">"This listing adds priority when it comes to the conservation of the koala,"</span> Environment Minister Sussan Ley said on Friday.</p></div>
	
					<p class="paragraph7">She said officials were designing a recovery plan, and land development applications would now be assessed for impacts on the species.</p>
	
					<p class="paragraph8">Last year, a New South Wales inquiry found koalas would be extinct there by 2050 unless there was urgent action.</p>

					<div class="section-ph9"><p class="paragraph9">It estimated the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20 had killed 5,000 koalas and affected 24% of habitats in New South Wales alone.</p></div>

					<div class="section-quote-father"><div class="section-quote"><span class="quote round">"Today's decision is welcome, but it won't stop koalas from sliding towards extinction unless it's accompanied by stronger laws and landholder incentives to protect their forest homes."</span></div></div>

					<p class="paragraph11">Scientists warn that climate change will also exacerbate bushfires and drought, and reduce the quality of the animal's eucalyptus leaf diet.</p>
	
					<div class="section-ph12"><p class="paragraph12">Koalas are also found in South Australia and Victoria but their numbers are on the decline nationally, according to conservation groups.</p></div>
